## Optimization Focus
$ARGUMENTS

## Asset Categories to Optimize
- **Environments** (40+ assets): Metro corridors, IEZ facilities, post-cascade scenes
- **Faction Emblems** (10+ assets): Enhanced DIR emblems, tactical authenticity designs  
- **Production Art** (15+ assets): PROD series with web-optimized variants
- **Refined Assets** (25+ assets): REFINE_SHARP series with professional toning
- **Technical Demos** (22+ assets): PERFECT_PARAMS showcase examples

## Optimization Strategy
1. **Format Modernization**: Convert to AVIF/WebP with JPEG fallbacks
2. **Responsive Images**: Generate srcset with breakpoint-specific sizes
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement intersection observer with blur-up placeholders
4. **Critical Path**: Identify above-fold images for priority loading
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Measure current vs optimized payload sizes

## Performance Targets
- **LCP Improvement**: < 2.5s for hero images
- **File Size Reduction**: 60-80% smaller than current
- **Format Support**: AVIF (Chrome/Edge), WebP (universal), JPEG (fallback)
- **Quality Retention**: Maintain visual fidelity while optimizing compression

## Implementation Approach
- Setup Astro image optimization pipeline
- Create responsive image component library
- Implement progressive loading with LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders)
- Add metadata extraction for PERFECT_PARAMS showcase
- Build image gallery with advanced filtering and zoom capabilities

## Quality Assurance
- Visual comparison before/after optimization
- Performance impact measurement (Core Web Vitals)
- Cross-browser format support testing
- Mobile network simulation testing

## Activation
Begin comprehensive asset optimization with focus on maintaining the premium quality while achieving web-class performance.
