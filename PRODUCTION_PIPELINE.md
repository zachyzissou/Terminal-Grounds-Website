### Phase 2: Quality Assurance Integration
```python
# Quality Scoring Framework
def assess_asset_quality(asset):
    lore_alignment = check_terminal_grounds_aesthetic(asset)
    technical_quality = evaluate_resolution_and_detail(asset) 
    storytelling_impact = measure_environmental_narrative(asset)
    return (lore_alignment + technical_quality + storytelling_impact) / 3
```

#### Quality Control Checkpoints
1. **Lore Alignment**: Terminal Grounds post-cascade aesthetic
2. **Technical Excellence**: Resolution, lighting, detail consistency
3. **Storytelling Impact**: Environmental narrative effectiveness
4. **Web Optimization**: File size, loading performance, responsiveness

### Phase 3: Web Integration & Deployment
```javascript
// Automated Asset Pipeline Integration
const assetPipeline = {
    source: 'Terminal-Grounds/Style_Staging/_Recent_Generations',
    categories: ['environments', 'factions', 'renders', 'ui'],
    webOptimization: true,
    manifestGeneration: true,
    htmlSnippets: true
};
```
